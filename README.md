#GOLDEN RULE# \
	When a problem arrives be proactive and inform other group members if they cannot help you fix it talk to the Keijo \
	If you cannot attend group meeting tell the group  \
	Faster this is done the better \
\
#20.00 status meeting every weekday# \
	- Go through what you've done towards the project \
	- Go throught what you will do next \
\
\
#Code quality# \
	- no magic numbers ( const x = something) make the code self explaining\
	- Comment every function what it does so other group members can understand it\
	- only call functions in the main \

#Documentation# \ 
	- every time something is finished go to the document and write what you did \
	- Friday documentation organization \
\
#Version control# \
	- Github will have folders with everystage done by each person. At status meetings we merge these iterations \
	- in github we make iterations of the code update everytime you do something  \
	\
	\
#Flow charts# \
